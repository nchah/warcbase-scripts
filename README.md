# warcbase-scripts

This repository was created to manage part of the workflow for a team project by "Team Turtle" during the Archives Unleashed Datathon 2.0 (http://archivesunleashed.com/) held between June 13-15, 2016 at the Library of Congress in Washington DC.

This work was presented at the [Saving the Web: The Ethics and Challenges of Preserving Whatâ€™s on the Internet](https://www.loc.gov/loc/kluge/news/save-web-2016.html) Symposium on June 16, 2016. 

## Project

The Library of Congress provided 145 ARC files that contained data from crawls during the days leading up to the 2004 US Presidential election. We used this data to explore the following research question.

Research Question: Which places and topics did the two presidential candidates mention most in the days leading up to the 2004 election? 


## Workflow

Steps 1 and 4 are covered in this repository. The other steps were covered by colleagues in the group.

1. Parse and clean the text from WARCs of party/candidate websites using warcbase
2. Extracted Named Entities (candidate names, state names)
3. Topic modeling (LDA, TF-IDF)
4. Semantic Web extension - Google Knowledge Graph API and Wikidata


## Step 1. warcbase

The open-source warcbase repo is [here](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase).

Install and open up the warcbase REPL.

```
# Start up the warcbase REPL in the terminal
$ spark-shell --jars target/warcbase-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-fatjar.jar

# Or start up warcbase with additional memory
$ spark-shell --driver-memory 8G --jars target/warcbase-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-fatjar.jar

```

Once the Scala REPL is loaded, starting running the scripts in [WarcsToTsv.scala](https://github.com/nchah/warcbase-scripts/blob/master/WarcsToTsv.scala).

The script should make it possible to iterate over hundreds of WARC/ARC files and output the relevant textual data into TSV files.

```
scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

```

Then, merge all of the individual TSV files into a single master TSV with a single Bash command in [merge-tsv.sh](https://github.com/nchah/warcbase-scripts/blob/master/merge-tsv.sh).

```
$ # Merge each TSV file named "part-00000" located in distinct folders
$ cat ./*/part-00000 >merged.tsv

```


## Step 4. Semantic Web extension

The [kg-api.py](https://github.com/nchah/warcbase-scripts/blob/master/kg-api.py) script is a Python CLI tool to query the Google Knowledge Graph API. This script is meant to serve as a Semantic Web extension to the topic modelling and Named Entity Recognition (NER) done in steps 2 and 3 of the project workflow.


```
$ python kg-api.py 'library of congress'
